Samuel Bader
================

I will use this repo as a blog.

I will describe in depth some of my projects and the choices I made.

I will also try to write small articles about, either algorithm exercises I solved, or simply some kind of tutorials about problems I encountered in my projects.

I'm still a student in this field, and don't pretend to give perfect solutions, I just want to practice writing, to share what I know, if possible to teach other people, and will be glad to get your opinions.
